# Nashville Housing  Analysis

This project analyzes housing prices in Nashville to uncover key trends, identify undervalued properties, and provide actionable insights for smarter investment decisions.

## Project Overview

With Nashville's dynamic real estate market, understanding housing price trends is critical for investors and policymakers. This project leverages advanced data analytics and visualization techniques to explore housing price patterns, relationships between property features, and value disparities.

## Dataset

The dataset includes property records from the Nashville housing market, with the following key variables:
- **Sale Price**: The final price for property transactions.
- **Building Value**: The appraised value of structures on the property.
- **Land Value**: The appraised value of the land.
- **Finished Area**: The total finished living area in square feet.
- **Neighborhood**: The location details of properties.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing and inconsistent values.
   - Created calculated fields such as "Price-to-Value Ratio" to analyze discrepancies between sale price and appraised value.

2. **Visualization and Analysis**:
   - **Distribution Analysis**: Created a histogram of sale prices to understand the price range and density.
   - **Comparative Metrics**: Used scatter plots to compare sale prices with building and land values.
   - **Neighborhood Insights**: Visualized property distribution and pricing trends by neighborhoods.

3. **Key Metrics**:
   - Identified undervalued and overvalued properties based on "Price-to-Value Ratio."
   - Highlighted price trends and their correlation with property size and neighborhood location.

## Key Findings
