This project analyzes housing prices in Nashville to uncover key trends, identify undervalued properties, and provide actionable insights for smarter investment decisions.

## Project Overview

With Nashville's dynamic real estate market, understanding housing price trends is critical for investors and policymakers. This project leverages data analytics and visualization techniques to explore housing price patterns, relationships between property features, and value disparities.

## Dataset

The dataset includes over 22,000 property records from Nashville, encompassing 27 variables. Key variables include:

- **Sale Price**: The final price for property transactions.
- **Building Value**: The assessed value of the building.
